Appdaemon Widgets for Home Assistant 

This is an AppDaeomon HADashboard widget radio allows to stream online radio channels to media_player on Home Assistant: https://www.home-assistant.io. 
It provides a volume slider and it shows the current state, volume and radio station.

I like to improve to get the current listening radio station preselected on the drop-down menu. But first it will take me weeks to set up my HADashboard to control my home.
